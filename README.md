Hi, my name is Joan Redon, and this is my first webpage, its made only using HTML.

Its a recipe webpage, where I uploaded my learned cooking recipes during my time studying in Denmark.

It consists of a simple main page (index.html), and the diferent recipes in its own .html file, all stored
in a folder called recipes.

To store the images shown in the web i created a folder called images.

And thats all, Hope you like it!!!
