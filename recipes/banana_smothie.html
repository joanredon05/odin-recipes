    <h3>Description: </h3>
    <p>Banana shakes can be made to benefit weight loss or gain, a fitness 
        routine, vegan diet, or low carb lifestyle. You can enjoy them as 
        a snack, quick and easy breakfast, or even as a dessert option.</p>
        
    <p>Unlike juicing, blending can incorporate all of the edible parts 
        of fruits and vegetables â€” including the skin, seeds and pulp 
        so a smoothie can be nutritionally very similar to eating the 
        produce whole.</p>
